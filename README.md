# CoravelWindowsService
[Coravel](https://docs.coravel.net/) is a lightweight scheduling library by James Hickey that allows for the extremely concise definition of scheduled jobs.

This .NET 7+ solution is a simple example illustrating how it can be used to implement a Windows service which handles ad-hoc scheduled jobs defined in an application configuration file. It also illustrates how to integrate [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) into a Windows service.
